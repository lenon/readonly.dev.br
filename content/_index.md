### Hi! I am Lenon and this is my blog, readonly

I started this blog to share my thoughts and learnings about software
engineering. Here, I expect to write about programming with Ruby, Python and
Clojure among other languages. I am also interested in scaling systems,
deployment strategies, continuous integration and delivery, so I'll be writing
about tools and concepts like Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, among others.

Please feel free to reach me out on [LinkedIn][1], [GitHub][2] or by [email][3].
