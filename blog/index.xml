      <description>While writing a small Python library to download and parse a large CSV file from the web, I had to implement a strategy to cache the file locally and avoid downloading it on every execution. I wanted the library to download the file only once on the first execution and also when it has changed on the server. In this blog post I&amp;rsquo;m describing how to implement this with Python, basic HTTP headers and file manipulation.</description>

      <description>I decided to start a new blog and, after looking at many of the available options for blogging, I chose a static site generator.

So in this blog post I describe how I&amp;rsquo;m using it along with GitHub actions to automatically deploy this blog to GitHub Pages.</description>
